# Project Brief

This project delivers a Dockerized Jekyll-based static website using the Awesome Jekyll Theme. It addresses the need for a fully serverless, portable site that can be deployed on any container platform without requiring a managed server. Content authors will write pages in Markdown within VS Code, push changes to GitHub, and see updates automatically served in a Docker container.

## Objectives
- Scaffold a new Jekyll site and integrate the Awesome Jekyll Theme cloned locally.
- Package the site and theme into a Docker image for development and deployment.
- Enable live-reloading local development via `docker-compose up`.
- Host the source code in a GitHub repository for collaborative content updates.
- Provide clear instructions to deploy the Docker container anywhere (cloud provider, on-prem, etc.).
- Maintain a memory bank of project context, patterns, and progress for continuity.
